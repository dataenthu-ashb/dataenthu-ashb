### 📂 2. `Forecasting_Project_VLK/`

A collaborative forecasting project with VLK, focused on economic and sales time series.

**Highlights:**

- 🛠️ **Data Wrangling Scripts**: Cleaned and pre-processed large, complex datasets.
- 📈 **Models Used**:
  - **ARIMA**
  - **MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling Regression)**
- 📄 **Final Report**: Includes insights, methodology, and conclusions.
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, and visual diagnostics.
- 🔗 **Use Case**: Mid-frequency predictors with high-frequency data (e.g., weekly sales vs monthly economic indicators).

> _A great example of applied econometrics and forecasting in practice._
