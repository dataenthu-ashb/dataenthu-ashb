    "## Question 1\n",
    "Kes goes to the market and likes to buy herself some nice and fresh ingrediants. She can buy salmon (200 gram) for 4 euros, advocados for 1 euro a piece and bread for 0.95 euro per loaf. Ask the user how much Kes buys this Saturday and calculate how much it costs. The print statement must be in a nice format, we don't want to sound weird and tell her to pay 1 euros or 0 euros and 95 cents. Thus you must format the senctence so that it is grammatically correct and that it does not include unessarty parts. Format it along the lines of \"You spend x euro(s) and y cents at the market this Saturday.\".\n",
