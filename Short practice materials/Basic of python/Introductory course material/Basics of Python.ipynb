Introduction & History of Python"],"metadata":{"id":"kcJxRL6rh5HH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FKdGiKnfUK61"},"source":["Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and has been developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was primarily developed with an emphasis on code readability, as its syntax allows you to express concepts in fewer lines of code.\n","\n","\\\\\n","Let’s dig deeper – In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. Work on Python had started. Soon after, Guido van Rossum began application-based work in December 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), located in the Netherlands. It first began as a hobby project to keep him occupied during Christmas. Now, the programming language to precede Python is said to have sbeen the ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and featured exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career, and although he saw some issues with the programming language, he liked most of its features. So he took the syntax of ABC and other good features, while clearing some of its issues, thus creating a robust scripting language with seemingly no flaws.\n","\n","\\\\\n","The inspiration for the name came from the BBC TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and wanted a short, unique, and slightly mysterious name for his invention. He was the “Benevolent Dictator for Life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position on 12th July 2018. For quite some time, he worked for Google and Dropbox, although he is now working for Microsoft.\n","\n","\\\\\n","The language was finally released in 1991. It required significantly fewer lines of code to express concepts compared to Java, C++, and C. Python's design philosophy was well-received too. Its main objectives are to provide code readability and enhance developer productivity. Upon its release, it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, multiple core data types, exception handling, and functions.\n","\n","## 1.1. Features\n","\n","Python is a dynamic, high-level, free, open-source, and interpreted programming language. It supports both object-oriented and procedural-oriented programming. In Python, there is no need to declare the type of a variable because it is a dynamically typed language. For example, x = 10; here, x can be anything such as a String, int, etc.\n","\n","There are many features in Python, some of which are discussed below:\n","\n","- **Easy to Code**: Python is a high-level programming language that is very easy to learn compared to other languages like C, C#, JavaScript, Java, etc. Coding in the Python language is quite straight-forwards, you can easily learn the basics of Python in a few hours.\n","\n","- **Free and Open Source**: Python is freely [available for download on its official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Since it is open-source the source code is also available to the public. Source code is human-readable, but can also be converted to machine code through a compiler or assembler.\n","\n","- **Object-Oriented Language**: One of the key features of Python is its support for object-oriented programming. Python supports concepts of classes, objects, encapsulation, etc.\n","\n","- **High-Level Language**: When we write programs in Python, we do not need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage memory.\n","\n","- **Extensible Feature**: Python is an extensible language. We can write Python code into C or C++ language and also compile that code in C/C++ language.\n","\n","- **Portable Language**: For example, if we have Python code for Windows and want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac, we do not need to change it; we can run this code on any platform.\n","\n","- **Integrated Language**: Because we can easily integrate Python with other languages like C, C++, etc.\n","\n","- **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line by line, unlike other languages like C, C++, Java, etc., where there is no need to compile Python code. This makes it easier to debug our code. The source code of Python is converted into an intermediate form called bytecode.\n","\n","- **Large Standard Library**: Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of modules and functions, so you do not have to write your own code for every situation.\n","\n","\\\\\n","Knowing how to code with Python is a valuable skills which can be beneficial in your future career. Some companies that use Python include: Google(Components of Google spider and Search Engine), Yahoo(Maps), YouTube, Mozilla, Dropbox, Microsoft, Cisco, Spotify, Quora, and more.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aNW84lq__sJz"},"source":["# 2.

In a notebook you can have blocks of text like this one and blocks of code (like the one below), which facilitates reading and structuring.\n","\n","In this course we will be using Google Collab as our IDE, but another recommended IDE is Jupyter Notebooks.

Names of class attributes and methods which are intended to be \"private\" and not accessed from outside the class should start with an underscore (we will come back to this later in the course).\n","\n","Of course there are always exceptions -- for example, many common\n","mathematical symbols have very short names which are nonetheless widely\n","understood.\n","\n","Here are a few examples of identifiers:\n","\n","| Syntax error   | Bad practice | Good practice  |\n","|----------------|--------------|----------------|\n","| Person Record  | PRcrd        | PersonRecord   |\n","| DEFAULT-HEIGHT | Default_Ht   | DEFAULT_HEIGHT |\n","| class          | Class        | AlgebraCourse  |\n","| 2totalweight   | num2         | total_weight   |\n","\n","\\\\\n","💡 Be careful not to redefine existing variables accidentally by reusing\n","their names.
