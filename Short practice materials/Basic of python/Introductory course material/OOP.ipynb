However, while a procedural style can suffice for writing short, simple programs, an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach becomes more valuable as your program grows in size and complexity.\n","\n","The more data and functions your code uses, the more important it is\n","to arrange them into logical subgroups, making sure that related data and\n","functions are grouped together and that unrelated data and\n","functions don't interfere with each other. Modular\n","code is also easier to understand and modify, and lends itself more to reuse -- and code reuse is valuable as it reduces development time.\n","\n","As a worst-case scenario, imagine a program with a hundred functions and\n","a hundred separate global variables all in the same file. This would be\n","a very difficult program to maintain. All the variables could\n","potentially be modified by all the functions even if they shouldn't be,\n","and in order to pick unique names for all the variables, some of which\n","might have a very similar purpose but are used by different functions, we might have to resort to poor naming practices, making it easy to confuse these variables.\n","\n","We could try to make this code more modular without object orientation, by grouping related variables into aggregate\n","data structures. In the past, some other languages, like C++, introduced a `struct` type which eventually became indistinguishable from a class,\n","but which initially didn't have any methods -- only attributes. This\n","allowed programmers to construct compound variables out of many\n","individual variables, and was the first step towards object orientation.\n","In Python, dictionaries are often used for ad-hoc grouping of related data.\n","\n","We could also split up the functions and data into separate *namespaces*\n","instead of having them all defined inside the same *global namespace*.\n","This often coincides with splitting the code physically into multiple\n","files.

If you want to use the data stored in an object to\n","perform an action or calculate a derived value, you define a method\n","associated with the object which does this.

It is considered bad\n","practice to retrieve the information from the object and then write\n","separate code to perform an action *outside* of the object.\n","\n","Encapsulation is a good idea for several reasons:\n","\n","-   The functionality is defined in only *one* place.\n","\n","-   The data and the functionality are stored in the same place, making it more logical.\n","-   Data inside our object will not be unexpectedly modified by external code\n","    in a different part of our program.\n","-   When a method is used, you only need to know what that method produces -- you don't need to know details about the object's internals in order to use it.\n","\n","It is said that the object \"knows\" how to do things with its own data,\n","and it's a bad idea to access its internals and manipulate the data outside of the object. If an object doesn't have an interface method performing the action you need, you should add a new method or update an existing one.\n","\n","Some languages have features which allow us to strictly enforce encapsulation. In Java or C++, you can define access permissions on object\n","attributes, and make it illegal for them to be accessed from outside the\n","object's methods.\n","\n","In Python, encapsulation is not enforced by the language, but there is a convention that is used to indicate that a property is *intended* to be private and is not part of the object's public interface: beginning its name with an underscore.\n","\n","It is also customary to set and get simple attribute values directly,\n","and only write setter and getter methods for values which require some\n","kind of calculation.
